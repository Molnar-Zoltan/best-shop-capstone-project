The project uses **vanilla JavaScript**, **SASS**, and **live-server** for development.

**(It was completed as part of the EPAM Front-End Fundamentals training program.)**

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

To set up and run the project, use only **two commands**:

**1. Install dependencies:**
- npm install

**2. Compile SASS, run linting, and launch the development server**
- npm run dev

**This command will:**
- Run JS and SCSS linting to check for code issues
- Compile the SCSS files into CSS (src/scss/main.scss → dist/main.css)
- Start a live server serving the project (./src)
- Watch for changes in SCSS files and recompile automatically
